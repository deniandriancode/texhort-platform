**TODO BUT COOL**

- [ ] create a web app to memorize words, first search the suitable method
	  ```
	  for this, first just create a web app where we shuffle a list of words fed by user than the user must guess the word.
	  
	  use javascript or something, this is focused more on frontend
	  ```

**TODO**

- [ ] add author for texhort
- [ ] add date published for texhort

more todo
